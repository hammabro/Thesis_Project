The objective of this project is to design and implement an intelligent system for automating the valuation of used cars' market values, aimed at streamlining 
the insurance reporting process in case of accidents. The solution employs web scraping to gather real-time data from second-hand car marketplaces and machine 
learning models to predict accurate car valuations. Additionally, the system integrates a robust workflow for data analysis, model evaluation, and fine-tuning 
to enhance prediction accuracy, providing an innovative tool for the Tunisian insurance sector.
